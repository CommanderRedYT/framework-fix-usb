# framework-fix-usb

Had a problem that your Framework Laptop does not power up / recognize USB devices like a mouse or yubikey?

This script will rebind all the USB devices, which (at least for me) fixed the issue.

## Installation

Either put it in some folder thats in your `$PATH`, or if you use archlinux:

```bash
$ yay -S framework-fix-usb
```
